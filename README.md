# NeloCrypto's BIO

Age: 36

Been in the space looking it mature since 2017, where I did my first ETH transactions. I have some private vaults running 24/7. I can consider myself a savy daily crypto user.

Background in Computer Science and a formal +10 years career working with all types of company structures, Big 4s, small startups, freelance work and some side projects. Looking to contribute to the crypto space in a positive way, by publishing some of my software, tools, and doing contributions to opensource crypto projects.
