# NeloCrypto's CV

Age: 36

Background in Computer Science and a formal +10 years career working with all types of company structures, Big 4s, small startups, freelance work and some side projects. Looking to contribute to the crypto space in a positive way, by publishing some of my software, tools, and doing contributions to opensource crypto projects.

Because I would like to remain anon I'm only listing crypto related work.

Also, I have been playing wih software since I was around 13 so I welcome roles and work which are not development 100% of the time.
